			<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>Since I was a kid, I've always loved everything that had to do with computers, spending a lot of time exploring the Windows system as well as playing games on older consoles, like my first one, the Xbox 360, or the Nintendo 3DS, Playing on my cousins Playstations, etc.</p>
			<p>I was also very artistically inclined, constantly drawing in my free time and sketching up ideas for myself, worldbuilding with my ideas as an expression of creative outlet.</p>
			<p> In 6th grade, I discovered Scratch and fell in love with the idea of creating my own game, mixing my love for computers and programming with the art I had always made to comfort myself.</p>
			<p>Because of this, I decided to major in Computer Science with a Simulation/Animation/Gaming minor at Eastern Michigan University. My goal is to create my own games and softwares, so that other people can feel inspired as well.</p>
